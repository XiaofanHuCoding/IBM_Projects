## Project Details
### 1. Scraping and Analyzing Basketball Statistics
  - It is a guided project from IBM Python Basics for Data Science course.
  - In this project, I used beatifulsoup package in python to scrap basketball players' Statistics from Wikipedia.
  - The purpose of the guided project is to learn how to use beatifulsoup packeage and how to scrap online data, and to conduct some basic data cleaning and analysis

### 2. Simple Linear Regression
  - This is a practice project from IBM Machine Learning with Python - A Practical Introduction course.
  - In this project, I used car fuel consumption/CO2 emission data from Canadian government and built simple regression model to predict cars' emission by using simple linear regression.
  - The results show a reasonable linear regression model can be built by using Engine size as an independent variable. I used Mean absolute error, Residual sum of square, and R2-score to evaluate the model.
