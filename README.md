## Project Details
### 1. Scraping and Analyzing Basketball Statistics
  - It is a guided project from IBM Python Basics for Data Science course.
  - In this project, I used beatifulsoup package in python to scrap basketball players' Statistics from Wikipedia.
  - The purpose of the guided project is to learn how to use beatifulsoup packeage and how to scrap online data, and to conduct some basic data cleaning and analysis

### 2. Simple Linear Regression
  - This is a practice project from IBM Machine Learning with Python - A Practical Introduction course.
  - In this project, I used car fuel consumption/CO2 emission data from Canadian government and built simple regression model to predict cars' emission.
  - The results show a reasonable linear regression model can be built by using Engine size and as an independent variable. I used Mean absolute error, Residual sum of square, and R2-score to evaluate the model.

### 3. Multiple Linear Regression
  - This is a practice project from IBM Machine Learning with Python - A Practical Introduction course.
  - In this project, I used car fuel consumption/CO2 emission data from Canadian government and built multiple regression model to predict cars' emission.
  - The results were improved by using Engine size, Cylinders, and Fuel Consumption Combination as independent variables. I used Mean absolute error and Residual sum of square to evaluate the model.

### 4. Polynomial Regression
  - This is a practice project from IBM Machine Learning with Python - A Practical Introduction course.
  - In this project, I used car fuel consumption/CO2 emission data from Canadian government and built polynomial regression model to predict cars' emission.
  - The results seemed not as good as simple linear regression model by using Engine size as an independent variable. Mean absolute error, Residual sum of square, and R2-score were used to evaluate the model.

### 5. Non-linear Regression
  - This is a practice project from IBM Machine Learning with Python - A Practical Introduction course.
  - The first part of this project, I used randomly generated data to show typical non-linear regression models. The second part of this project, I built a non-linear regression model by using China's GDP from 1960 to 2014.
  - The model was built by using sigmoid function from scipy. Mean absolute error, Residual sum of square, and R2-score were used to evaluate the model.

### 6. K-Nearest Neighbors
  - This is a practice project from IBM Machine Learning with Python - A Practical Introduction course.
  - The dataset was from a telecommunication provider and it has information about the customers. The goal is to predict which customers belong to which groups so the company could provider better service plans.
  - The model was built by using KNN. The model was evaluated by using accuracy parameter and it indicates that when k=38, the model has the best accuracy.

### 7. Decision Tree
- This is a practice project from IBM Machine Learning with Python - A Practical Introduction course.
- The dataset was collected from a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and Drug y.
- I built a Decision Tree model to predict which types of patients should use what kind of drugs. The prediction action is 0.98 which indicates a very good match between prediction and test set.

### 8. Logistic Regression
- This is a practice project from IBM Machine Learning with Python - A Practical Introduction course.
- The dataset was from a telecommunication company that can be used for predicting customer churn. This is a historical customer dataset where each row represents one customer. The data is relatively easy to understand, and you may uncover insights you can use immediately. Typically it is less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company.
This data set provides information to help you predict what behavior will help you to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.
- A logistic regression model was built to predict customer churn. F1 score and log loss were used for model evaluation.

### 9. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- This is a practice project from IBM Machine Learning with Python - A Practical Introduction course.
- The dataset was from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Asuncion and Newman, 2007). It consists of several hundreds human cell sample records, each of which contains the values of a set of cell characteristics.
- The SVM used for predicting results was evaluated by accuracy and confusion matrix.
