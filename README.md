## Project Details
### 1. Scraping and Analyzing Basketball Statistics
  - It is a guided project from IBM Python Basics for Data Science course.
  - In this project, I used beatifulsoup package in python to scrap basketball players' Statistics from Wikipedia.
  - The purpose of the guided project is to learn how to use beatifulsoup packeage and how to scrap online data, and to conduct some basic data cleaning and analysis

### 2. Simple Linear Regression
  - This is a practice project from IBM Machine Learning with Python - A Practical Introduction course.
  - In this project, I used car fuel consumption/CO2 emission data from Canadian government and built simple regression model to predict cars' emission.
  - The results show a reasonable linear regression model can be built by using Engine size and as an independent variable. I used Mean absolute error, Residual sum of square, and R2-score to evaluate the model.

### 3. Multiple Linear Regression
  - This is a practice project from IBM Machine Learning with Python - A Practical Introduction course.
  - In this project, I used car fuel consumption/CO2 emission data from Canadian government and built multiple regression model to predict cars' emission.
  - The results were improved by using Engine size, Cylinders, and Fuel Consumption Combination as independent variables. I used Mean absolute error and Residual sum of square to evaluate the model.

### 4. Polynomial Regression
  - This is a practice project from IBM Machine Learning with Python - A Practical Introduction course.
  - In this project, I used car fuel consumption/CO2 emission data from Canadian government and built polynomial regression model to predict cars' emission.
  - The results seemed not as good as simple linear regression model by using Engine size as an independent variable. Mean absolute error, Residual sum of square, and R2-score were used to evaluate the model.

### 5. Non-linear Regression
  - This is a practice project from IBM Machine Learning with Python - A Practical Introduction course.
  - The first part of this project, I used randomly generated data to show typical non-linear regression models. The second part of this project, I built a non-linear regression model by using China's GDP from 1960 to 2014.
  - The model was built by using sigmoid function from scipy. Mean absolute error, Residual sum of square, and R2-score were used to evaluate the model.

### 6. K-Nearest Neighbors
  - This is a practice project from IBM Machine Learning with Python - A Practical Introduction course.
  - The dataset was from a telecommunication provider and it has information about the customers. The goal is to predict which customers belong to which groups so the company could provider better service plans.
  - The model was built by using KNN. The model was evaluated by using accuracy parameter and it indicates that when k=38, the model has the best accuracy.
